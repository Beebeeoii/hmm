# Hidden Markov Model

This project seeks to investigate more on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with data taken from a subreddit, in particular [r/nus](https://reddit.com/r/nus).

## Getting Started

### Gathering Data

1. Make a copy of `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`

2. Fill in `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` and `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` after [creating a new app on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).

3. Run `./scrapper.py`
